introduction: The "Learn" project aims to enhance communication between teachers and parents. To achieve this goal, we conducted several interviews in the initial stage of the project and concluded that there is a need to improve communication between teachers and parents. Consequently, we created a preliminary design of the program using Figma. At this stage, the main objective is to convert this Figma design into a complete program that we can launch to users using Flutter and the Dart programming language.

Certainly, here are some features that can be implemented in the "Learn" application, prioritized accordingly:

1. Live Chat: Enable direct messaging to facilitate communication between parents and teachers.
2. Notification Delivery: Send notifications to parents to update them about the latest developments and important events.



It seems like you encountered several difficulties and errors when converting the design from Figma to Flutter using Dart. It's common to face challenges during the conversion process, especially when dealing with different tools and platforms. Let's translate your statement into English:

"At this stage, we faced many problems and difficulties when converting from Figma to Flutter using Dart. We used several programs for the conversion, including Figma and Dhiwise, but encountered many errors, as shown in the code."

If you provide more specific details about the errors you encountered or the code you're working with, I can try to assist you further in resolving those issues.
